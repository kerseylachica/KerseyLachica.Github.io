In this project, I used Python to analyze a flotation plant, Metals R Us, and investigate a weird occurrence on June 1, 2017 regarding their iron flotation process. With 737,453 rows and 24 columns, the iron attributes highlighted in this article were the % iron concentrate (our target end product), % silica concentrate (an impurity), ore pulp pH, and flotation column 05 level. Pairplots were used to illustrate the correlation between the four variables. A lineplot was used to illustrate the % iron concentrate fluctuations throughout the day specified.

In this project, I used Tableau to create 4 charts to analyze 2022-2023 NBA stats. The four charts include a heatmap, bubble plot, stacked bar, and a treemap containing factors such as teams, players, positions, and scoring system that evaluated 3-point shooting efficiency, total points scored by team and player, and total assists.

[<img src="images/healthcare thumbnail.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uncovering-racial-disparities-hospitalization-trends-analysis-kersey-ged4c/)
In this project, I used SQL to uncover potential racial disparities by looking into the number of lab procedures and medications. I also analyzed hospitalization trends such as the relationship between lab procedures and time spent in hospital, lab procedures and medical specialty, successful patient treatments, and distribution of patient stay at the hospital.

#### [Massachusetts Education Project with Tableau](https://www.loom.com/share/2ee97c208ec2404ba3e667739821db27)
[<img src="images/massachusettseducation.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.loom.com/share/2ee97c208ec2404ba3e667739821db27)
In this project, I was tasked as a recent hire to analyze the Massachusetts Education data using Tableau. I created a dashboard to display and illustrate how class sizes affect college admission, the top math schoools in the state based on the 4th grade MCAS Math reports, and schools that were struggling the most across 1800 schools and almost 1 million students.

#### [DoorDash Project with Excel](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/doordash-project-using-microsoft-excel-kersey-lachica-pgrzc/)
[<img src="images/doordash.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/doordash-project-using-microsoft-excel-kersey-lachica-pgrzc/)
In this project, I used Excel for data analysis and data visualization to analyze 2018 iFood data and discovered insights on how customer demographics such as income, age, number of kids at gome, marital status, and educational background contribute to the total spending of these delivery service platforms.
