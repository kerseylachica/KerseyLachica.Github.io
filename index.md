In this project, I used Excel for data analysis and data visualization to analyze 2018 iFood data and discovered insights on how customer demographics such as income, age, number of kids at gome, marital status, and educational background contribute to the total spending of these delivery service platforms.

In this project, I was tasked as a recent hire to analyze the Massachusetts Education data using Tableau. I created a dashboard to display and illustrate how class sizes affect college admission, the top math schoools in the state based on the 4th grade MCAS Math reports, and schools that were struggling the most across 1800 schools and almost 1 million students.
