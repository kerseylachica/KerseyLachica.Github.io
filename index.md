In this project, I used SQL to uncover potential racial disparities by looking into the number of lab procedures and medications. I also analyzed hospitalization trends such as the relationship between lab procedures and time spent in hospital, lab procedures and medical specialty, successful patient treatments, and distribution of patient stay at the hospital.

In this project, I was tasked as a recent hire to analyze the Massachusetts Education data using Tableau. I created a dashboard to display and illustrate how class sizes affect college admission, the top math schoools in the state based on the 4th grade MCAS Math reports, and schools that were struggling the most across 1800 schools and almost 1 million students.

In this project, I used Excel for data analysis and data visualization to analyze 2018 iFood data and discovered insights on how customer demographics such as income, age, number of kids at gome, marital status, and educational background contribute to the total spending of these delivery service platforms.
